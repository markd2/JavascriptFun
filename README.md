Playing / Learning JavaScript and VSCode

I have a new Mentee for [Underdog Devs](https://www.underdogdevs.org), who is a web developer and primarily uses javascript / node / VSCode.  Since I'm a swift-C / iOS / emacs (and begrugingly Xcode) nerd, I need to come up to speed on new stuff.

This whole repo is developed and edited using VSCode.  I hate learning new editors...
