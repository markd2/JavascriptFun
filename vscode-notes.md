# VSCode Notes

Yay new editor and environment.  

# Useful keybindings

* control-shift-backtick - open terminal in same directory as current file.

# Broken things I need to fix


# Things that drive me nuts

* The box around the current line. I feel crowded
* The highligting around () delimiters.  Rarely do I want that. At least the kiss animation isn't the BRIGHT YELLOW thing that Xcode does.
* Don't like the auto-insertion of close delimiter
* Getting a terminal error on launch
    "Unable to resolve your shell environment: Unexpected exit code from spawned shell (code 1, signal null)"
* Has some emacs bindings, but not meta-key support (for moving )
* Minimap
* Wow - TINY slop on left side for selecting lines.  I keep hitting the collapse bar which I don't typically use
*
